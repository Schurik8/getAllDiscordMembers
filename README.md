# Get all Discord Server Members
Here I make an Script where you can get all the Members on the Server.

**!!IMPORTANT!!**


You cant do it that is the Reason:
Wenn you want to access the member list of a server without using a bot, unfortunately, that's not possible. Discord has built-in security mechanisms to control and protect access to such information. Without using a bot and the corresponding permissions, access to server information is not allowed. This is to safeguard the privacy of users and the security of the platform. If you need specific information, it would be best to use the Discord API and bots in accordance with Discord policies.
